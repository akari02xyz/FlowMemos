# Privacy Policy — FlowMemos

_Last updated: 2025-09-05_

FlowMemos (the “App”) is provided by **akari02xyz** (“we”, “us”, or “our”). We respect your privacy and aim to be clear about what data is handled by the App.

## 1. Data We Handle
- **User Content (Memos):** Your memos are stored **locally on your device**. We do not transmit your memos to our servers (we do not operate a backend).
- **Advertising:** The App displays banner ads via **Google Mobile Ads (AdMob)**. AdMob may process device identifiers (e.g., advertising IDs), coarse location, and app interaction data to deliver and measure ads.
  - Google Ads policies: https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads  
  - AdMob help & privacy: https://support.google.com/admob

## 2. How We Use Data
- We do **not** read or upload your memos off the device.
- Ad-related data is processed by AdMob for ad delivery, frequency capping, and measurement.

## 3. Third Parties
- **Google AdMob** (ads). Please see Google’s policies linked above for details on data processing.

## 4. Your Choices and Controls
- You can restrict ad tracking on your device (e.g., iOS “Limit Ad Tracking”/App Tracking Transparency, Android Ads settings).
- You can remove local data by deleting memos in the App or uninstalling the App.

## 5. Children’s Privacy
The App is not directed to children under 13. If you believe a child provided personal data, please contact us and we will address the issue.

## 6. International Transfers
Ad networks (e.g., Google) may process data on servers located outside your country. See Google’s policies for details.

## 7. Your Rights (where applicable)
Depending on your jurisdiction (e.g., EU/UK/California), you may have rights to access, delete, or restrict processing of personal data handled by third parties such as AdMob. Please review Google’s documentation and your device settings for exercising these rights. You may also contact us (details below).

## 8. Security
We take reasonable measures to keep data limited (local-only memos) and rely on reputable providers (Google) for advertising. No method is 100% secure.

## 9. Changes to This Policy
We may update this policy from time to time. The latest version with the “Last updated” date will be posted on this page.
